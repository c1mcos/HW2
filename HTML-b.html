              What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of

              But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An
              autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
              powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling
              allocation, and end-to-end encryption.

              Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.
